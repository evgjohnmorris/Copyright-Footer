# Copyright-Footer
Automatically Updating Copyright Footer, Updates with Copyright Declaration, Copyright Symbol, date, time, and name of the copyright holder. It also supplements with a declaration of all rights being reserved. Marquee scrolling on the footer as well. very simple, nothing fancy, but still pretty interesting and useful and eye catching. God bless!! 
Just find the the files, copy the files and upload them into your platform, edit the html file, change the name from my name to you or your organization, and then find your link to embed the item into your platform.
